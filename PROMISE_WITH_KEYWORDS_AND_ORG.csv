15,"POS devices are not required to support the cancel last purchase command. If this command is supported, the POS device must have security to prevent unauthorized or fraudulent use of the transaction",SE
15,"The CEP card verifies that the PSAM is the PSAM used in the original transaction, computes a S1 MAC using the same DES session key that was used for the purchase transaction being cancelled, and responds to the POS device with the S1 and the identification of the last transaction. If the purchase transaction to be canceled has been canceled or is not part of the active batch, the command is not allowed",SE
15,The PSAM either retrieves or re-derives the DES session key used for the purchase transaction being cancelled. The POS device authenticates the CEP card using this key and the S1 MAC,SE
15,The PSAM in the POS device generates a merchant acquirer S5 MAC for the transaction and a new S4 MAC for the batch total count and amount and logs the transaction.

15,"A credit command, which contains the S2 MAC computed by the PSAM using the session key, is sent to the CEP card",SE
15,The CEP card authenticates the terminal using the S2 MAC and the session key from the purchase transaction being cancelled. The CEP card increments the value of the purse and logs the transaction. The CEP card verifies that the cancellation amount is equal to the amount of the last step of the purchase transaction,SE
15,A transaction collection process must exist. Data being transmitted from the POS devices must be transmitted in a manner that ensures integrity of the data,SE
15,The PSAM must create a MAC on the updated aggregation record. Aggregation records by card issuer must be stored in the PSAM. They may also be stored in the POS device as well,SE
15,"Each POS transaction completed at the POS device is given a S5 MAC by the PSAM, which is used by the merchant acquirer to validate that the transactions were made at a POS device with a valid PSAM. The batch total count and amount must be protected by the S4 MAC, which must also be validated by the merchant acquirer",SE
15,"The merchant acquirer validates the PSAM MACs prior to accepting the POS transactions for payment. In addition, selected data elements are validated to ensure correct processing by the POS device and its PSAM",SE
15,"Each purchase transaction is signed by the CEP card with a S6 MAC, which is used by the card issuer to validate that the transaction was made with a legitimate, not counterfeit, CEP card. The card issuer validates the CEP card MAC",SE
15,"Payment decisions are based on signature validations, scheme provider rules, and merchant and merchant acquirer agreements",SE
15,"Errors may be introduced by a malfunctioning PSAM or POS device software, by key management problems, or through the transmission process, as well as through fraudulent activities of another entity. When a batch or POS transaction fails validation, the merchant acquirer or card issuer must follow exception procedures that affect payment to the merchants and payment from the card issuer. The batch must be analyzed to determine clearable transactions out of a corrupted batch",SE
15,Purchase transactions that have an invalid MAC are forwarded to the scheme provider for analysis if the scheme provider has established a central error repository,SE
15,"Pay on detail is the default payment arrangement for merchant acquirers to provide payment to their merchants. In this arrangement, the merchant acquirer relies on the POS transaction S5 MAC to determine acceptance. Merchants are paid only for valid POS transactions",SE
15,All load transactions are on-line transactions. Authorization of funds for load transactions must require a form of cardholder verification. The load device must support on-line encrypted PIN or off-line PIN verification,SE
15,Off-line PIN verification must include both encrypted and unencrypted PIN,SE
15,The card verification method indicator (CVMI) in the CEP card must specify support of online PIN verification and at least one method of off-line PIN verification (encrypted or unencrypted),SE
15,"Where it is necessary for a CEPS system component to distinguish between on-line and off-line cardholder PIN verification, a flag must be set in the transaction",SE
15,"Since these transactions are on-line to the issuer, the issuer has the opportunity to lock the card or the application. These transactions are not available to a card that has already been locked",SE
15,"For unload transactions, the load acquirer and card issuer must be the same financial institution. Load devices or load acquirers must be able to identify their own institution CEP cards",SE
15,Only one version of the CA public key is required in the card. This requires that the PSAMs with which the CEP card exchanges cryptograms must be capable of generating and validating cryptograms using the relevant keys from all current cards,SE
15,"Two-way, or mutual, authentication, where the card authenticates the terminal and the terminal authenticates the card for each transaction, must be performed for off-line transactions",SE
15,"For increased security and convenience, asymmetric cryptography must be used as the authentication security for off-line transactions",SE
15,"The card must authenticate the terminal at the point of sale, ensuring that it is genuine and valid, and use a two-way authentication process",SE
15,"The terminal must authenticate the card and the transaction at the point of sale, ensuring that they are genuine and valid",SE
15,The terminal must participate in a two-way authentication process with the card,SE
15,"For cancel last purchase transactions, the terminal must validate the card and sign the cancellation",SE
15,The terminal must secure transactions by retaining the card symmetric MACing key signature as part of the transaction,SE
15,The terminal must generate a symmetric MACing key signature and send it to the merchant acquirer,SE
15,"Incremental purchase transactions must use two-way authentication for the initial session authentication, and at least one-way, with the terminal authenticating the card, for the remaining increments or some of the remaining increments",SE
15,Load and unload functions must be authenticated using end-to-end security between the card and the card issuer,SE
15,The issuer host must authenticate the card upon the load/unload request,SE
15,The card must authenticate the issuer host upon the response to the request,SE
15,A proof must be sent to the load acquirer that a load or unload occurred to avoid repudiation,SE
15,"The management of keys must be accomplished in a secure, certified environment",SE
15,"There may be multiple certification authorities that manage keys for the system, including the possibility of one overall highest level certification authority (perhaps on an international level), and domestic certification authorities for each country or region",SE
15,"The system must protect the integrity of key transaction data including transaction identification, currency code and amount. If tampering is suspected, the system must cause the transaction to fail",SE
15,"Funds issuers must accept funds authorization requests, regardless of the load currency type, as permitted",SE
15,Authorizations for load transactions require a form of cardholder authentication for funds requests,SE
15,The load device must support on-line PIN encryption or off-line PIN verification,SE
15,The load device which supports only off-line PIN verification must support both the off-line PIN encryption method and the off-line PIN plain text verification method as defined in EMV,SE
